= SmartCatToy Startup


â€¦ is a toy controlled via a webapp to entertain our feline friends during our absence.

The idea behind this project is to provide a cheap alternative to expensive toys, with which you can provide entertainment for lonley single cats in flats.

    - control toy remotely
    - provides autopilot mode
- Back End
    - receive Data from App
    - send Data to Mobile app
- Database
    - Store Data from Backend
- Infrastructure
    - Running nodejs
    - Running database
    - reachable via internet

== Nice to Have

- replace autopilot (random generator) via inteligent movement detection

== Platform Overview

![Platform Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rmm2908/smartcattoy/main/documentation/static/images/Overview.png)  

The client application is developed using Ionic 7 with Angular and can be deployed to iOS, Android and the Web.

The hardware toy is running a python script to receive data from the client and acts as the central inteligence hub of the hardware, housing the logic of the hardware and sends the commands over a Serial Interface to Arduino.

Arduino just receives the commands from python script on the Raspberry Pi and controls all sensors and motors.

Both the client application and the cattoy don't communicate directly to each other but to a server hosted on azure web application.

It is a NodeJS Express application that acts as an intermediary to establish connection between those two devices using WebSockets to enable low latency.



== Hardware Overview

![Hardware Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rmm2908/smartcattoy/main/documentation/static/images/HardwareOverview.png)  

A raspberry pi acts as the central logic hub, which is powered by a power bank.
It is directly connected to an Arduino Uno over a USB Serial Connection to establish bidirectional communication.

The Arudino receives all commands from the python script running on the raspberry to controll the motors attached to it. 
As the communication is bidirectional, it could send sensor data back to the raspberry, if those should be added.
